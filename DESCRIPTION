Title: Break Chained Expressions and Run Them with Printed Output
Version: 0.3.0
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Miles",
           family = "McBain",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "miles.mcbain@gmail.com",
           comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0003-2865-2548"))
Description: Run an infix operator expression chain up to the line your
  cursor is on, printing the output, and ignoring any result assignment step.
  This facilitates easier interactive debugging of chained code. Common
  examples of code amenable to breaking with this tool are {dplyr} wrangling
  chained with `%>%`, and {ggplot2} plotting chained with `+`.
